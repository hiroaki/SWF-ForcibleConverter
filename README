NAME
    SWF::ForcibleConverter - convert SWF version forcibly

SYNOPSIS
        use SWF::ForcibleConverter;
    
        my $fc = SWF::ForcibleConverter->new;
        my $size = $fc->convert9($input, $output);

DESCRIPTION
    SWF::ForcibleConverter is a utility that converts format of SWF file
    into the version 9 forcibly.

CONSTRUCTOR
    An constructor new() accepts an hash reference as configure option.

        my $fc = SWF::ForcibleConverter->new({
                    buffer_size => 4096,
                    });

    The option has following keys are available.

  buffer_size
    Buffer size (bytes) when reading input data.

    Note that it is 4096 necessity at least, or croak.

METHOD
    On the following explanation, $input and $output are file path or IO
    object.

    Both are omissible. In that case, it uses STDIN or STDOUT.

        $ cat in.swf | perl -MSWF::ForcibleConverter -e \
            'SWF::ForcibleConverter->new->convert9' > out.swf

  buffer_size([$num])
    This is accessor. When $num is given, it sets the member directly,
    without validation. Please usually use [get|set]_buffer_size methods.

  get_buffer_size
    Get buffer size.

  set_buffer_size($num)
    Set buffer size.

    Note that it is 4096 necessity at least, or croak.

  version($input)
    Get version of SWF file.

  is_compressed($input)
    Return true if input is compressed

  uncompress($input, $output)
    Convert input SWF into uncompressed one.

    This method does not change format of version, simply outputs with
    uncompressing.

  convert9($input, $output)
        my $input   = "/path/to/original.swf";
        my $output  = "converted.swf";
        my $bytes   = $fc->convert9($input, $output);

    Convert input SWF into output SWF with changing version 9. And it
    returns size of output.

TODO
    Currently, an output is always uncompressed.

    Will it be able to support the other versions? It is difficult for me...
    :-(

NAME
    SWF::ForcibleConverter - convert SWF version forcibly

SYNOPSIS
        use SWF::ForcibleConverter;
    
        my $fc = SWF::ForcibleConverter->new;
        my $size = $fc->convert9($input, $output);

DESCRIPTION
    SWF::ForcibleConverter converts format of SWF file into the version 9
    forcibly.

CONSTRUCTOR
    An constructor new() accepts an hash reference as configure option.

        my $fc = SWF::ForcibleConverter->new({
                    buffer_size => 4096,
                    });

    The option has following keys are available.

  buffer_size
    Buffer size (bytes) when reading input data. Default is 4096.

METHOD
  buffer_size
        my $size = $fc->buffer_size; # getter
        $fc->buffer_size($integer);  # setter

    An access method to buffer_size.

  convert9
        my $input   = "/path/to/original.swf";
        my $output  = "converted.swf";
        my $bytes   = $fc->convert9($input, $output);

    Convert input SWF into output SWF with changing format version 9. And it
    will return output file size.

    Both input and output are omissible. In that case, it uses STDIN or
    STDOUT.

        $ cat in.swf | perl -MSWF::ForcibleConverter -e \
            'SWF::ForcibleConverter->new->convert9' > out.swf

TODO
    Currently, an output is always uncompressed.

    Will it be able to support the other versions? It is difficult for me...
    :-(
